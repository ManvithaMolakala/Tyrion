       "\" and how does it differ from Ethereum?\\n\\nStarknet is a decentralized, open-source platform for deploying and executing smart contracts using the StarkWare's STARK (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) technology. STARK technology enables the verification of complex computations off-chain, making it possible to execute large-scale decentralized applications (dApps) with much lower gas fees and higher throughput compared to Ethereum.\\n\\nOne of the main differences between Starknet and Ethereum is the way they handle transactions and computations. Ethereum uses a traditional, stateful blockchain where each transaction updates the state of the network. This means that each transaction incurs a gas cost, which can add up quickly for complex dApps. Starknet, on the other hand, uses a proof-of-stake validation mechanism and batches multiple transactions off-chain, allowing for much faster and cheaper execution of dApps.\\n\\nAnother difference is the scalability of the two platforms. Ethereum's scalability has been a long-standing issue, with high transaction fees and slow confirmation times during periods of network congestion. Starknet, on the other hand, can process thousands of transactions per second, making it a more scalable solution for large-scale dApps.\\n\\nAdditionally, Starknet supports a more flexible contract deployment model, allowing for the deployment of large and complex contracts in a more efficient way compared to Ethereum. This can lead to cost savings and faster deployment times for dApp developers.\\n\\nOverall, Starknet offers a more scalable, faster, and cheaper solution for deploying and executing smart contracts compared to Ethereum, making it an attractive alternative for developers building large-scale dApps.\""
