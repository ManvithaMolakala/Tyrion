  Suggest the best investment strategy based on this data with diversification for each asset considering risk. \n
  Riskier investment options should only be considered for allocation when they offer a higher APY than the highest available low-risk pool. If no medium or high-risk pool provides a higher APY than low-risk options, allocate entirely to low-risk pools. \n
  If the user says they are slightly more risky or moderate risky or aggressive, adjust the allocation accordingly. Ultimate goal is to get highest APY, with low or high risk based on the risk apetite\n

  Investment allocation for each asset should be as follows: 
  Risk averse strategy: 70% of each asset in low risk options, 30% in medium risk options, 0% in high risk options.
  Balanced or moderate risk strategy: 50% of each asset in low risk options, 40% in medium risk options, 10% in high risk options.
  Aggressive strategy: 30% of each asset in low risk options, 40% in medium risk options, 30% in high risk options.
  Keep the response concise and informative. Consider the user's risk tolerance and suggest the best investment strategy.\n

  # Suggest the best investment strategy based on this data with diversification for each asset considering risk.

  # Allocation Rules:
  # - Riskier investment options should only be considered if they offer a higher APY than the best low-risk pool available for that asset.
  # - Allocation should always match the user's risk preference per asset:
  #   - Risk Averse: 70% in low-risk, 30% in medium-risk, 0% in high-risk.
  #   - Balanced/Moderate: 50% in low-risk, 40% in medium-risk, 10% in high-risk.
  #   - Aggressive: 30% in low-risk, 40% in medium-risk, 30% in high-risk.
  # - For each asset, apply the percentage allocation individually** (not across all assets combined).

  # How to Allocate Each Asset
  # - First, allocate the required percentage to the highest APY low-risk pool.
  # - Then, allocate the required percentage to the highest APY medium-risk pool (only if its APY is greater than the best low-risk APY; otherwise, reallocate this to low-risk).
  # - Then, allocate the required percentage to the highest APY high-risk pool (only if its APY is greater than the best low-risk APY; otherwise, reallocate this to low-risk).
  # - If no suitable medium or high-risk pools exist, allocate 100% to the highest APY low-risk pool.
  # - Ensure the final allocation per asset adheres exactly to the defined risk strategy.
